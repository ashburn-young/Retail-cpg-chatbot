# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures and considerations for the Retail CPG Chatbot.

## ðŸ”’ Security Status: âœ… ALL CLEAR

### Recent Security Fixes (June 2025)

âœ… **All critical vulnerabilities have been resolved**

#### Safety Check Results
- **Status**: âœ… PASSING (0 vulnerabilities reported)
- **Previous vulnerabilities fixed**:
  - **aiohttp** (<3.10.11): Updated to 3.10.11+ - Fixed CVE-2024-42367, CVE-2024-23334, CVE-2024-52304, CVE-2024-52303, CVE-2024-27306, CVE-2024-30251
  - **starlette** (<0.40.0): Updated to 0.46.2 - Fixed CVE-2024-47874, PVE-2024-68094  
  - **anyio** (<4.4.0): Updated to 4.9.0 - Fixed PVE-2024-71199
  - **setuptools** (<78.1.1): Updated to 80.9.0 - Fixed CVE-2025-47273, CVE-2024-6345

#### Bandit Check Results
- **Status**: âœ… PASSING (No issues identified)
- **Legitimate warnings suppressed**: Network binding warnings for web server functionality (B104) with `#nosec` comments
- **Code scanned**: 3,786 lines of project code (excluding venv, tests, examples)

## Security Checks

### 1. Bandit (Static Security Analysis)

We use Bandit to scan for common security issues in Python code. Current suppressions:

- **B104 (hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces)**: Suppressed for development server configuration
  - Location: `config/settings.py` and `app.py`
  - Reason: Development server needs to bind to 0.0.0.0 for Docker and local development
  - Mitigation: In production, configure proper host binding through environment variables

- **B311 (random)**: Suppressed for template selection
  - Location: `modules/response.py`
  - Reason: Using `random.choice()` for response template selection (non-cryptographic purpose)
  - Mitigation: This is acceptable for UI purposes, not used for security-sensitive operations

### 2. Safety (Dependency Vulnerability Scanning)

We use Safety to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Current status:

- **Updated Dependencies**: All major vulnerabilities have been addressed by updating to secure versions
- **aiohttp**: Updated to 3.10.11+ to address CVE-2024-42367, CVE-2024-23334, and others
- **fastapi**: Updated to 0.115.0+ which includes updated Starlette dependency

### 3. Dependency Management

#### Secure Versions
- `aiohttp>=3.10.11` - Addresses multiple CVEs
- `fastapi>=0.115.0` - Includes secure Starlette version
- Regular updates to maintain security

#### Development vs Production
- Use `requirements-minimal.txt` for CI/CD with essential dependencies only
- Use `requirements.txt` for full development environment

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- All user inputs validated using Pydantic models
- SQL injection prevention (though we don't use SQL directly)
- XSS prevention through proper response encoding

### 2. Error Handling
- No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- Proper logging without exposing secrets
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Session management for conversation tracking
- Rate limiting considerations (can be added via middleware)
- CORS properly configured

### 4. Data Protection
- No persistent storage of sensitive user data by default
- Analytics data anonymized
- Configurable data retention policies

## Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Configure proper host binding (not 0.0.0.0)
- [ ] Set up HTTPS/TLS encryption
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Review and test authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Audit all environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Enable security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Incident Response

1. **Vulnerability Detection**: Automated scanning in CI/CD
2. **Assessment**: Review severity and impact
3. **Remediation**: Apply patches or updates
4. **Testing**: Verify fixes don't break functionality
5. **Deployment**: Deploy fixes using established CI/CD pipeline

## Reporting Security Issues

For security issues, please:
1. Do not open public GitHub issues
2. Contact the security team directly
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Include potential impact assessment

## Regular Security Maintenance

- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly security reviews
- Annual penetration testing (for production systems)
- Continuous monitoring of security advisories
